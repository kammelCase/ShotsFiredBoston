# ShotsFiredBoston

### The What.
It's an exploration of gun violence in Boston, MA to see if gun violence is increasing or decreasing year-over-year while detrending for extraneous factors such as seasonlity and weather.

### The Why.
Gun violence is a major issue in the United States. It's an issue that I've covered as a documentarian and journalist, with my work being published by ReelSouth and PBS.

So I wanted to know how my hometown, Boston, is faring in the midst of this nationwide epidemic.
