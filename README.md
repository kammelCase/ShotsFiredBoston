# ShotsFiredBoston

Initial commit. Incoming updates.

# Notes (for now):
- incorporate district data
- consider using different models for different districts

# Current ToDo
- need to create aggregates by week
- think that'll be the best way to create a doable y for this set
- incorporate day of the week
- incorporate holiday check: T or F

# Later ToDo
- separate model to account for weather, day of the week, etc
- what happened on the outlier days? (10+ shots fired)
